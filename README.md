# Optimizing Link State Routing Algorithm

## Problem Statement
This project aims to optimize the Link State Routing Algorithm (LSRA) using NetworkX, a Python library for graph analysis. The project focuses on enhancing the efficiency of shortest path calculations, reducing routing convergence time, and simplifying LSRA implementation for network simulations.

## Objectives
1. Enhance the efficiency of shortest path calculations.
2. Reduce routing convergence time.
3. Simplify LSRA implementation for network simulations.

## Implementation
The LSRA implementation utilizes the NetworkX library for graph representation and analysis. The `lsra.py` file contains the main LSRA class, which allows adding edges to the network graph and calculating shortest paths between nodes.
